# postgis-tutorial

Welcome to the beginners PostGIS course! In this course, we will introduce you to PostGIS, an open-source spatial database extender for the PostgreSQL database management system. PostGIS allows you to store, manipulate, and query geospatial data in a relational database environment.

This course assumes that you have a basic understanding of databases and SQL. If you need a refresher, we recommend taking a basic SQL course before starting this course.

By the end of this course, you will be able to:

 - Understand the basics of geospatial data
 - Install and set up PostGIS
 - Create spatial tables
 - Insert and manipulate geospatial data
 - Query spatial data using SQL and PostGIS functions


### Lesson 1: Introduction to Geospatial Data

In this lesson, we will introduce you to geospatial data and its types. We will also discuss the importance of spatial data in various fields such as urban planning, transportation, and ecology.

 - What is geospatial data?
 - Types of geospatial data
 - Applications of geospatial data

### Lesson 2: Installing and Setting Up PostGIS

In this lesson, we will guide you through the process of installing and setting up PostGIS on your computer. We will cover the following topics:

 - Installing PostgreSQL
 - Installing PostGIS extension
 - Creating a spatial database

### Lesson 3: Creating Spatial Tables

In this lesson, we will show you how to create spatial tables in PostGIS. We will cover the following topics:

 - Creating a spatial table
 - Adding geometry columns
 - Specifying the spatial reference system (SRS)

### Lesson 4: Inserting and Manipulating Geospatial Data

In this lesson, we will show you how to insert and manipulate geospatial data in PostGIS. We will cover the following topics:

 - Inserting geospatial data
 - Updating geospatial data
 - Deleting geospatial data

### Lesson 5: Querying Spatial Data

In this lesson, we will show you how to query spatial data using SQL and PostGIS functions. We will cover the following topics:

 - Basic SQL queries
 - Spatial SQL queries
 - PostGIS functions for spatial analysis

Congratulations! You have completed the beginners PostGIS course. With this knowledge, you can start exploring the world of geospatial data and create amazing applications using PostGIS.
